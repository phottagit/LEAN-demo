# User Images Directory

This directory contains user profile images that are uploaded during registration.

These images are committed to the repository to ensure they're available in the Vercel deployment.

## Important Notes

1. After registering new users locally, remember to commit the new images to GitHub before deploying to Vercel.
2. This approach is suitable for applications with a limited number of users.
3. For applications with many users, consider using a dedicated image storage service like AWS S3, Cloudinary, or Vercel Blob Storage.
